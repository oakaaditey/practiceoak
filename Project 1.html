                  <h3>Ellora Caves </h3> 
                  <img src="elephanta caves.jpg">
                  <p>Ellora is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India. It is one of the largest
                  rock-cut Hindu temple cave complexes in the world, featuring Buddhist and Jain monuments with artwork dating from the period 
                  600–1000 CE.Cave 16 features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world, the Kailash temple, a chariot-shaped
                  monument dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Kailash temple excavation also features sculptures depicting the gods, goddesses found 
                  in Hinduism as well as relief panels summarizing the two major Hindu Epics.

                  There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to public.
                  These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13to29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1to12) and 5 Jain (caves 30to34) caves, each group representing deities and 
                  mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as monasteries of each respective religion.They were built close to one an
                  other 
                  and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India. All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta dynasty, 
                  which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves, and the Yadava dynasty, which constructed a number of the Jain caves. Funding for 
                  the construction of the monuments was provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.
                        
                  Although the caves served as temples and a rest stop for pilgrims, the site's location on an ancient South Asian trade route also made it 
                  an important commercial centre in the Deccan region. It is 29 kilometres (18 miles) north-west of Aurangabad, and about 300 kilometres
                   (190 miles) east-northeast of Mumbai. Today, the Ellora Caves, along with the nearby Ajanta Caves, are a major tourist attraction in the
                    Marathwada region of Maharashtra and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

                   <h3> Elephanta Caves </h3> 
                   <img src="ellora caves.jpg">
                   <p>esignated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, the Elephanta Caves are a collection of cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu 
                         god Shiva. They are on Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri (literally "the city of caves"), in Mumbai Harbour, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) ea
                         st of Mumbai in the Indian state of Mahārāshtra. The island, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, consis
                         ts of five Hindu caves, a few Buddhist stupa mounds that date back to the 2nd century BCE,and two Buddhist caves with water tanks.

                        The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, mostly in high relief, that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas and i
                        conography. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged. The
                         main temple's orientation as well as the relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern. The carvings narrate 
                         Hindu mythologies, with the large monolithic 20 feet (6.1 m) Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and 
                         Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being the most celebrated.
                        
                        These date to between the 5th and 9th centuries, and scholars attribute them to various Hindu dynasties. They are most commonly placed
                         between the 5th and 7th centuries. Many scholars consider them to have been completed by about 550 CE.
                        
                        They were named Elefante  which morphed to Elephanta by the colonial Portuguese who found elephant statues on the caves. They 
                         established a base on the island. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived
                         , whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship. The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the caves were started 
                         by British India officials in 1909.[15] The monuments were restored in the 1970s. In 1987, the restored Elephanta Caves were designated a 
                         UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
